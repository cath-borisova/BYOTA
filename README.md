In this VR experience, users can passively interact with trigonometric wave concepts by generating the terrain around them.

For the class project, we implemented the World In Miniature interaction. If the user presses the 'A' button, the map of their world appears, along with 3 different objects that they can place into the world. The 3 objects consist of a tree, a bush and a rock. When the user grabs the object, it automatically clones and creates a smaller version that can be placed on the map. Once it is placed on the map, it's position is mapped to a real world, and a larger version of the object is placed into the real world. There is also a small circle on the map that shows where the user is at all times.

All models were taken from the Polygon Adventure pack that we used in class.
